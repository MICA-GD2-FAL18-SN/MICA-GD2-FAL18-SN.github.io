  <p> Blurrel is a strong man because he has several super powers he could use and
    he is also talented in martial arts so he can protect himself from the danger
    and is qualified to save people outside. However, since he has grown up by so many
    accidents and lost a lot of people near him, he got sensitive and often get emotional
    at night time. He has trauma of the emergency siren sound and he will think of the
    bad memories he had in that moment.
