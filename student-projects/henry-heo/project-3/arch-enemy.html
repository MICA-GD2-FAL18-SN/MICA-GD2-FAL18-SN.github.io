  <div class="description">

  <p>The villain in this story is called "Mizzy" and this villain was created by a medical accident after applying for the medical experiment for the future medicine. She volunteered the clinical test because she needed money to pay for her delayed housing fee. She were hoping to have a better life this opportunity and but as an after effect from the test, she realized her saliva and touch of the skin can poison other people. As a worse thing, she had a conflict with the house owner and her anger exploded and started using her super power to anyone who she doesn't like. She is short-tempered and gets annoyed by Blurrel's interrupt everytime where she's making a crime. </p>
