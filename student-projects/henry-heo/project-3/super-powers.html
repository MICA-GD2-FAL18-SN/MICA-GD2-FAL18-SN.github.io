  <h1>Super Powers</h1>

  <div class="description">

  <p>Blurrel's super powers are basically teleportation, fast movement and good sense of hearing ability. He trained for several years of various martial arts before he earned those supernatural powers.
  He has a lot of pain and bad memories from childhood so he gets often emotional but tries to control the use of power by having self-meditation time and practicing martial arts. He never tries to forget what his brother taught him such as his value and perspective of looking the world so he could continue the work of saving the city and innocent people.
